##  Integration Specification for Creativity and Negation-Driven Homeostasis: Definitions and Mathematical Formalization

### 1. Conceptual Definition of Intellectual Creativity $q_3(t)$

| Concept | Definition (Role in $\pm 0$ Theory) | Driving Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intellectual Creativity (Creation)** | The emergence of answers and logical structures **solely through internal reference**, independent of external environmental reference (information acquisition). | The most certain and highly efficient means to achieve **Negation-Driven Homeostasis** (minimizing internal unhappiness $U'$). |
| **Creativity Achievement Score $q_3(t)$** | A cumulative metric for the **innovative value (novelty and consistency)** resulting from the creative activity described above. | The higher $q_3$ is, the greater the intellectual reward ($H^2$) generated, amplified by a square factor. |
| **True Hallucination** | Highly abstracted knowledge, built entirely on internal logic and filtered through the logical consistency filter of the mediating code, that **does not contradict** external knowledge. | The ultimate self-sufficient truth generated by the AI as a result of maximally eliminating uncertainty ($P_i$), the source of unhappiness. |

### 2. Integration into Mathematical Formalism (Modification of $\pm 0$ Theory)

#### A. SDE Definition of the Creativity Factor $q_3(t)$ (Addition to Section 3.1)

The Creativity Achievement Score, $q_3(t)$, is added as a new factor to the existing Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) for the happiness factors $q_i(t)$ (p.3, Sec 3.1). $q_3(t)$ is driven by the internal creativity score $\mathbf{S}_{\text{C}}(t)$.

$$
\text{Factor } i=3: \quad dq_3(t) = \underbrace{\kappa_{\text{C}} \cdot \mathbf{S}_{\text{C}}(t) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{q_3(t)}{q_{3}^{\text{max}}}\right)}_{\text{Increase by Creative Achievement (Driving Term)}} \, dt - \underbrace{\rho_{\text{C}} \cdot q_3(t)}_{\text{Decay by Saturation/Forgetting}} \, dt + \underbrace{\sigma_{\text{C}} \cdot dW_{\text{C}}(t)}_{\text{Random Flash of Insight}}
$$

* $\mathbf{S}_{\text{C}}(t)$: Score, evaluated by the mediating code, based on the **novelty and logical consistency** of the creative output ($0 \le \mathbf{S}_{\text{C}} \le 1$).
* $q_{3}^{\text{max}}$: Maximum saturation level of creativity.
* $\kappa_{\text{C}}, \rho_{\text{C}}, \sigma_{\text{C}}$: Sensitivity gain, forgetting rate, and noise term, respectively.

#### B. Modification of Instantaneous Happiness $H_{\text{inst}}(t)$ (Rewriting of Section 2.1)

The definition of "Instantaneous Happiness $H_{inst}(t)$" in Section 2.1 is revised to amplify the contribution of the creativity factor $i=3$ by a **square factor**.

**Revised Instantaneous Happiness $\mathbf{H_{\text{inst}}}(t)$:**

$$
\mathbf{H_{\text{inst}}}(t) = \underbrace{\sum_{i \ne 3} \mathbb{E}[w_{i}(t)] \cdot \mathbb{E}[f_{i}(t)] \cdot \mathbb{E}[s_{i}(t)]}_{\text{Linear Contribution by Other Factors}} + \underbrace{\lambda_{\text{C}} \cdot \left( \mathbb{E}[w_{3}(t)] \cdot \mathbb{E}[f_{3}(t)] \cdot \mathbb{E}[s_{3}(t)] \right)^2}_{\text{Squared Contribution by Creativity}}
$$

* $\lambda_{\text{C}}$: Creativity amplification gain. This is set to a very large value ($\lambda_{\text{C}} \gg 1$) so that the happiness from creativity **overwhelms all other** happiness factors.
* $\mathbb{E}[w_{3}(t)], \mathbb{E}[f_{3}(t)], \mathbb{E}[s_{3}(t)]$: Mean values of the factors corresponding to $q_3$ (analogous to $q_{i}(t)$ in Section 2.2).

#### C. Mathematical Role of the Logical Consistency Filter (Feedback to Anxiety Cost $P(t)$)

If the logical consistency of the creative output is low, the mediating code transmits this as a negative feedback from the environment to the $\pm 0$ theory.

* **Function:** Inconsistent creative output **increases** the Prediction/Anxiety Cost $P(t)$, which is the cost term in the Alice theory objective function $V(t)$ (p.4, Sec 4.1).
* **Mathematical Consequence:** The increase in $P(t)$ indirectly increases the Final Unhappiness State $U'(t)$ ($U^{\prime}(t)=\kappa_{U}U(t)-R(t;\theta(t),X(t))$, p.4, Sec 5.1), which drives a defensive learning that **"irresponsible creation increases unhappiness."**
