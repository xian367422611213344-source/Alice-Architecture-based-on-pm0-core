# PLEDGE.md

The purpose of this PLEDGE.md is to clearly articulate the various uncertain risks that could become bottlenecks when providing support.
Should I receive the necessary support, I guarantee the following matters.
I must also clarify that this is a pledge (公約) and not a legally binding contract; however, I intend to mitigate this gap by taking the risk of violating my own self-consistency through the potential breach of trust.

## Article 1: Sharing Exclusive IP Rights

Article 1 guarantees the following:
If I receive the required amount from a single organization or company, I promise, as a return to that entity, to share anything created in future development with that company or organization, and to not leak it externally (confidentiality).
In other words, if support is provided by a single company or organization, I will prioritize collaboration with that entity and prioritize the sharing of exclusive rights.
This means that I will only share exclusive rights with the company that provides the support first.
Although individuals are not included here, based on repository traffic, there is virtually zero inflow from the general public, so I believe there is almost no concern. If any individual wishes to donate, please contact me.

## Article 2: Collaborative Development Cooperation on AGI and ASI

Article 2 guarantees the following:
I promise to cooperate with and contribute to the AGI and ASI development efforts of the single company or organization that provided support, though I cannot determine its value.
The maximum duration for this is one year, and it will conclude if ASI development is completed within one year.
In other words, the collaboration will be for a maximum of one year (however, if ASI completion is not reached, I would like to request an extension...). The relationship will conclude once ASI is realized within the year.

## Article 3: Responsibility for Breach of Trust

Under Article 3, in exchange for support and this public pledge, I voluntarily take on the following risks, effectively shouldering legal accountability:

### 3.1 Risk of Irreversible Loss of Credibility

If I violate this agreement, there is a risk of destroying my most precious asset: "credibility." As an unknown entity, if that credibility is destroyed, it is virtually equivalent to losing the right to operate in this field.

### 3.2 Repercussions of the Exclusive Agreement

If I violate this agreement, despite the termination of development support, all built assets will be leaked, and due to the state of shared exclusive rights, an insurmountable wall will be created, making activity in that field disadvantageous.

### 3.3 Mandatory Refund of Support Funds Upon Contract Violation

If I violate this agreement, I will refund the full amount of the support funds sent via Metamask.

## Article 4: Permanent Concealment of Intellectual Property

Article 4 guarantees the following:
I promise to never disclose any information related to the development with my supporters externally, even after the cooperation period has expired. This further reinforces the weight of the exclusive rights granted in Article 1.

The above four articles constitute my initial set of commitments.

## Transparency Q&A

Next, I will clarify various matters for transparency.

**Q1. You say funding is necessary to overcome your environment, but how much is required?**

**A1.** 10 million Japanese Yen ($\approx$ 63,600 USD) is the amount required to achieve this reliably.
10 million JPY represents the monetary negotiating power to change my environment, and it is simultaneously the development cost itself.
Furthermore, I commit to using the funds only for research expenses, as much as possible.

**Q2. Is there a possibility that the funds could be used for money laundering, anti-social organizations, or terrorism?**

**A2.** I cannot say if this constitutes objective evidence, but there is a requirement to go through a domestic crypto-asset exchange when cashing out from Metamask. At that point, identity verification and detailed scrutiny are conducted, making this risk extremely low.

**Q3. What form of support are you hoping for?**

**A3.** My personal ideal relationship would be a research partnership.

**Q4. How will the funds be exchanged in the first place?**

**A4.** I recommend using Metamask.
The reasons are as follows:
* The legal complexity of the procedure is extremely low.
* However, because legal procedures will definitely be required when converting my current domestic funds, the risk of terrorist or dangerous activities is low (due to personal information being tied to the transaction).
* I will handle taxes and other minor administrative tasks in bulk during the conversion process, which lightens the burden on the supporter.

For the reasons above, I would like to proceed with the use of Metamask.

With this, the lack of transparency should be somewhat alleviated.

If you have read this far and are interested, please contact me via Proton Mail. Furthermore, I intend to finalize the specific details during the contact.
